    # This alert is configured identically to the above alert, but it refers to a .dbalert.json file
    # instead of inlining the configuration in YAML. We recommend inlining the configuration in YAML
    # when you need to productionize the alert across different target (dev, staging, prod) and
    # using a .dbalert.json file when you have a single target alert that you author in the Databricks UI
    # or using the databricks bundle generate alert command.
